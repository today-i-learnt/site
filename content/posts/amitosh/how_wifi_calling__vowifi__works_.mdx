Some time last year, Reliance Jio and AirTel enabled Wifi Calling (Voice over
WiFi) for their customers. It was great news for someone like me who always had
frequent call drops as I stay in a dense apartment complex. LTE signal is too
weak to penetrate so many walls (technically speaking, they reflect and diffract
like the phenomena in Young's double-slit experiment).

However, WiFi calling by my carrier Jio behaved interestingly, if I set
my router's DNS to Cloudflare or Google Public DNS, it doesn't work. This piqued
my interest, I put on my hat and opened my "Mobile Computing" book which I read
ages ago &mdash; "GSM and LTE networks". And after a little Google search on "VoWiFi
call flow" enlightened me with much details (details below).

## EDGE, WCDMA, LTE and VoLTE

Cellular networks operate in circuit-switched mode or packet-switched mode.
The circuit-switched mode is synchronous and optimized for low latency communication
such as phone calls. Packet-switched media is suitable for bursty communications
such as mobile internet.

Early mobile networks ‚òéÔ∏è were circuit-switched only (similar to fixed phones). GPRS
(2G) introduced packet-switched network access enabling services like MMS, WAP
and mobile internet. The phones switched between circuit-switched when taking
calls and packet-switched when browsing the internet. This was the reason why you
could not talk and browse the internet on GPRS networks.

WCDMA (3G) continued with the same dual-mode approach as well with the
enhancement that phones now could use both modes simultaneously allowing calls
along with internet access.

LTE üì± or 4G network is a purely packet-based network. Circuit-switched calls were
an expensive legacy, a power-hungry relic of the past (think about 2 antennas) and
everyone wanted to get rid of it. However, in some carriers only
circuit-switched networks are available for calling, they force your phone to
degrade to WCDMA (thus eating more battery as you need 2 different antennas
again!). Some maintain for compatibility reasons and to provide a fallback
network (2G reaches everywhere!). Reliance Jio famously doesn't.

Thus Voice over LTE (VoLTE) was born. It uses a bunch of IP (internet protocol)
telephony network protocols such as SIP and RTMP, which is quite similar to the
protocols used in voice and video calling applications (WhatsApp, Viber, Skype
etc). Your phone connects to a telephony gateway called IMS (IP Multimedia
Services) which is routed to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephony Network)
allowing you to make calls. This communication happens directly over the LTE network
from your device to a system run by your carrier called Packet Data Gateway (PDG)
which bridges you to the IMS and IP (Internet) networks.

## VoWiFi

Since everything is running on standard IP based communication, it was easy to
provide the same set of IMS services over a different IP based access network --
your WiFi. VoWiFi is simply a connection to your carrier's IMS over the public
internet.

Your mobile now connects to another server called an Evolved Packet Data Gateway
(ePDG) which connects you to the PDG and subsequently the IMS and PSTN. LTE
networks are secure and encrypted while public internet is not. Hence, to
provide security, the communication to ePDG happens over an IPSec tunnel.

Since ePDG is just an IPSec server, it's IP address is resolved by a DNS query
`epdg.epc.mnc<MCC>.mcc<MCC>.pub.3gppnetwork.org` where MNC and MCC is the network
and carrier code respectively. You can find those codes by looking up in Android
network info.

## What do Jio and AirTel do and why doesn't it work on my WiFi

Doing a DNS query for `epdg.epc.mnc861.mcc405.pub.3gppnetwork.org` (this is for
Jio Karnataka) or `epdg.epc.mnc45.mcc404.pub.3gppnetwork.org.` (this is for
AirTel) over a Public DNS server like Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare
(1.1.1.1) will return a blackhole server. It will not connect. Since my ISP's
DNS was very unreliable, I had set my router to use Cloudflare DNS. VoWiFi didn't
work at all. My phone repeatedly tried to connect to the blackhole server
draining battery forever.

```
$ dig epdg.epc.mnc861.mcc405.pub.3gppnetwork.org

However, one day I changed my DNS to use ISP's DNS. VoWiFi connected instantly.
Strange. Upon digging I found that _the response to the above DNS queries was
different_. I don't know why.

```
$ dig @192.168.0.1 epdg.epc.mnc861.mcc405.pub.3gppnetwork.org

Possibly because these carriers do not want to give away free international
roaming, they have set up custom DNS zone files with each of the major ISPs in
India. Sadly for me, I now either have an option to drop calls (without VoWiFi)
or slow internet (with ISPs DNS).

But thankfully, [DNS works in surprising ways as well](/posts/nancy/dns_resolution/)!
I edited the `hosts` file on my router with manual DNS entries for my carrier's ePDG gateways.
It's a hack but it works until my carrier changes their ePDG gateway servers!
