While writing code, we often write tests side by side. Ideally, tests should
cover all the branches of your system, and any unwarranted modification should
cause a test failure. To ascertain the correctness of our code, we rely on Unit
tests and Integration tests.

What is an integration test?

An integration test tests whether a combined (integrated) set of modules in a
codebase work as expected. You can define integration tests for a module (for
monoliths) or even for the entire service, if possible (in case of microservices).

## Difference between unit tests and integration tests

![Testing Pyramid](../img/testing_pyramid.png)

A unit test involves testing a "unit" of code for its behavior isolated from
everything else; a unit can be a class or a method, or a module &mdash; the
definition is up to you.

Unit tests use mocks, spies, and test doubles extensively so that only the
component under test is the actual live code running while integration tests
execute almost all of the service/module code.

## What to cover in an integration test?

Your integration tests should cover any externally exposed public interface. It
gives you the confidence to refactor internal implementation detail at a later
point and quickly know if it broke an exposed behavior.

## How?

There are two schools of thought about integration tests -

1. The "Broad Integration Test" &mdash; Testing your module with live versions
of all dependencies.
2. The "Narrow Integration Test" &mdash; Testing your module with a test double
of your dependencies.

The former is also commonly called as an end-to-end test. It tests your module
against running
instances of the module's dependencies after deploying it in a test environment.

The one I am writing here is the latter. Integration tests using test doubles are
fast and lean enough to be integrated into your build pipeline using the same
set of tools and frameworks you use for writing your unit tests. For example,
without any other tools other than JUnit and WireMock, you can write an
integration test for a Java service talking to several other REST services.

Your integration tests should cover all the expectations from your API like:

1. Request validations
2. Error handling on the failure of dependent modules
3. Any locking, concurrency or idempotency guarantees your module provides

Test em' all!
