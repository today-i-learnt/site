Setting `__slots__` in your Python class can have significant gains in speed
and memory usage.

Python classes consists a magic attribute called `__slots__` &mdash; this
defines the attributes that an instance of the defining class can hold.

Python is a dynamic language so normally you can set any attribute to any object
as opposed to a static language like Java where you need to define a field
explicitly before setting any value. But this dynamic behaviour comes at a cost.
All Python objects are essentially a wrapper over a `dict` (the `__dict__`
attribute). This makes attribute access a lot slower and since we hold additional
baggage capacity, it makes object sizes grow to enormous amounts.

By defining [slots][1] you trade the dynamic behaviour for much faster access and
smaller memory requirements. Attributes are now directly stored in dedicated
slots instead of `__dict__` and can be directly accessed.

```python

class Product(object):
    __slots__ = ['name', 'price']

    def __init(self, name:str, price:int):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

    # ...
```

Let the lack of dynamic capabilities not scare you. _You are already writing
good code right?_ You should ideally not be adding attributes to objects during
runtime. A majority of the time this is true.

If you are using `mypy` or `pyre` then using slots will enforce an additional layer of safety.

## Disadvantages

> Noting is free

Slots, other than eliminating dynamic attributes, also make it impossible for
you to perform multiple inheritances without any of the parents having free slots.
