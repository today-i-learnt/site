Golang's closures are undoubtedly very helpful but can behave weird at
times.

## Closures

Any inline function that references variables from outside its body is a closure.
Here's a trivial example of a "higher-order function" (func returning func),
using a closure

```go

type StrFunc func (input string) string

func PrefixWith(prefix string) StrFunc {
    return func(input string) {
        return prefix + input
    }
}
```

If you are writing enough Go code, you will find yourself using closures
somewhere or the other. However, while using them, there are several gotchas's
that you must keep in mind.

## Closure over loop variables

Let's say we are doing some crazy stuff like:

```go
func main() {
    done := make(chan bool)

    values := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
    for _, v := range values {
        go func() {
            fmt.Println(v)
            done <- true
        }()
    }

    // wait for all goroutines to complete before exiting
    for _ = range values {
        <-done
    }
}
```

You may expect an output like:

```
a
b
c
```

While it will be:

```
c
c
c
```

This is because closures capture variables by reference and by the time the
goroutines run, the value of `v` is `c`

To prevent this from happening, explicitly capture the value of `v`. This will
give the desired output

```go

func main() {
    done := make(chan bool)

    values := []string{"a", "b", "c"}
    for _, v := range values {
        go func(v string) {
            fmt.Println(v)
            done <- true
        }(v)
    }

    // wait for all goroutines to complete before exiting
    for _ = range values {
        <-done
    }
}
```

## Race conditions

If two goroutines refer a variable through closure captures, you can very easily
end up with race conditions. Consider some code like this:

```go
type Record struct {
    name string
    value int
}

func doSomeWorkParallely() {
    tempRecord := Record{
        name: 'Temp'
        value: 1
    }
    data := dataFromService()
    for _, record in range data {
        go func() {
            // ...
            tempRecord.name = record.SomeValue
            tempRecord.value = record.SomeIntValue
        }()
    }
}
```

Such code is dangerous and you can easily end up with `tempRecord` being in an
inconsistent state. You can use a `Mutex` to synchronize the access but should you?
