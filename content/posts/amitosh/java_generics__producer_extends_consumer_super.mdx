I do quite a lot of Java as part of the work I do at Gojek and one of the most
helpful, but at times confusing part of the language is generics. Here I will be
mentioning an interesting concept I recently came across &mdash; PECS or "Producer
Extends, Consumer Super"

Generics in Java is invariant by default and is applied at compile-time. [Polymorphic][1]
type agruments do not imply polymorphism in generic types i.e, You cannot assign
`List<String>` to `List<CharSequence>`.

However, with `extends` and `super` you achieve "covariance" and "contra-variance"
that aids in desigining type-safe generic code aware of inheritance and polymorphism.

This is useful in defining methods that accept collection types.

- Use `? extends T` when the collection is "producing" items that you utilize. Like,
  iterating over all items of the collection. You only care if the items in list are
  compatible with `T` (i.e, sub-classes of `T`). This is covariance &mdash; narrowing of
  scope.
- Use `super` when collection is "comnsuming" items. Like, an `copyToList` method
  that copies current results into a list which allows you to store objects of type
  `T`. This is contra-variance &mdash; widening of scope.

## Example

## ? extends T &mdash; covariance

You need to apply a `List` of `Rule` over a state machine. Here the `List` is a
"producer".

```java
interface Rule {
    void apply(StateMachine m);
}

class FireWallRule implements Rule {
    // ...
}

class StateMachine {
    // ...
    public void apply(List<? extends Rule> rules) {
        // ...
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var m = new StateMachine();

        var rules = List.of(
            new FireWallRule(),
             // ...
        );

        m.apply(rules);
    }
}
```

This allows you to pass a `List` of any objects which are implementations of `Rule`

## ? super T &mdash; contra-variance

You need to store `FetchResult`s, a sub-type of `Result` into a `List`. Here the
`List` is a "consumer".

```java
interface Result {
    // ...
}

interface FetchResult extends Result {
    // ...
}

class Fetcher {
    putResult(List<? super FetchResult> output) {
        // ...
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var result = new ArrayList<Result>();
        var fetcher = new Fetcher();
        // ...
        fetcher.getResult(result);
    }
}
```

This allows to pass any `List` that can store a `FetchResult`.

However, such code wont work:

```java
List<? extends CharSequence> list = new ArrayList<>();

// ...

list.add("hello world"); // error here, cannot add
```

However, a normal `List<CharSequence>` will allow it.
