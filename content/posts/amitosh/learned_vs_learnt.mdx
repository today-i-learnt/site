While setting up this blog, I went with "learnt" but a little casual browsing
yielded me the fact that a majority of the internet uses "learned".

## Another Americas vs the Rest of the World

This, among the many other differences, is due to spelling differences between
British English and American English.

This reminded me of my school days when I was beginning to learn to code HTML
and was startled by "color" and "dialog". Since Indian English borrows heavily
from the Brits, (though we still have some words from the Americas), those words
startled me -- is there a mistake in the books?

Fast forward 10 years: I still encounter spelling and pronunciation
differences -- "cancelled" vs "canceled", "learnt" vs "learned".

 Some of the "context-switches" such as "color" while writing in code by "colour" elsewhere
have become muscle memory, some still warrant carefulness about the audience --
"cancelled" vs "canceled" is such an example. I remember politely contesting
a PR that asked for such a change -- I was just too used to cancel all uses of
"canceled".
