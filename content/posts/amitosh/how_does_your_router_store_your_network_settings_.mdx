You configure your router with your WiFi SSID and password and a bunch of other
settings. You will be surprised to know how your router stores the
data.

While I was busy [hacking my router][1] to edit my `/etc/hosts` over telnet, I
realised my router has volatile storage! In technical words, my router (as so is
yours) is running from a RAM disk overlayed over a read-only filesystem. This
means any changes to the filesystem gets lost after a reboot. Think of your
router booting off a live CD each time it starts-up.

Most consumer routers run some version of embedded Linux, running on either ARM
or MIPS CPUs. They have little RAM and flash memory, and most of it is merely
read-only. Check if your router provides telnet (most likely it does). If yes,
you can telnet to your router IP and check what's inside _without fear_ as any
modifications you make will be lost after a reboot.

## How does it store state?

But it stores state! Right? Yes. I assumed it's some folder or file inside
`/etc/hosts` but it's more complicated than that. Read-only flash memory (ROM)
is cheap. Embedded devices employ some variants of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable
Programmable Read-Only Memory) with a tiny amount of NV-RAM (Nonvolatile Random
Access Memory) to store data. These NV-RAM are capable of storing a few KB of
read-write memory in the form of key-value pairs. Your router stores all its
settings in this memory.

But Linux software such as iptables and dnsmasq expects configuration to be
present under `/etc/`. Without any requisite configuration present under those
files, they will refuse to start! So to fix this, routers mount their filesystem
using an OverlayFS (a mechanism to combine two file systems so that they appear
as one) with a RO base read from the ROM and a small RAM disk mounted as the
writable layer. As part of the early-init process, the values are loaded from
NV-RAM and written to appropriate files under `/etc` like `/etc/hosts`.

## Who updates the NV-RAM?

As you guessed, the configuration tool does. If you have shell access to your
router, you can also make use of the `nvram` command to read and write values
from the NV-RAM. The configuration tools are usually written in C and may
directly access NV-RAM as well.
