Service discovery can be compared to what DNS for your browser is but in a dynamic way.

When you connect to website your browser, have to find the IP address of the host hosting website you want to reach, for this, it does DNS query. Beforehand this you own the web service and website you have to configure DNS and register inside the IP address of the server of your server 

Service discovery is about the same things. Registering and query but for service.
