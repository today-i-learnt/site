Easy steps to start with deploying a Web Service in Kubernetes:

1. Make a docker image of your application
2. Push to docker registry 
3. Make a `deployment.yaml`

    It describes how pods will run; We will configure env variables here. 
4. To store application settings create one or more `configmap`.
5. To store one or more secrets create one or multiple secret.yaml and link it with `deployment.yaml`.
6. For one-off tasks such as migration, certificate renewal, etc. make one or more jobs.
7. To expose your web application, create a Service.
8. To make it available to public use Loadbalancer type Service.
9. Alternatively if you have ingress configure it to expose your service as well.
