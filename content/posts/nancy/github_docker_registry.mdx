Recently Github has made [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.blog/2020-09-01-introducing-github-container-registry/) free for public images.ü§©
Easy to manage and easy to maintain! 
It has become super easy to push your üê≥ Docker images now. I recently worked on pushing one the docker image at my organisation and want to share a simple
guide with you all. Here we go! 

## Authentication 

- Create a new personal access token (PAT) with following scopes :
    - read:packages 
    - write:packages 
    - delete:packages
- Type this in your terminal: 
    - `export CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN` 
    - `echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin` 

## Docker build and Push 

After authenticating build the docker image and push it!

Example : 
- `docker build -t ghcr.io/nancy-chauhan/keystore:latest .`
- `docker push ghcr.io/nancy-chauhan/keystore:latest`

Now if you are working for an organisation where you have a lot
of private repositories. You can setup container registry to host your internal
docker images. You can enforce access policies to control who can do what.
Here is a consolidated list arranged by me, which you can refer 
and can quickly set up things.
